----------
This is the course page for CSCI 39548 Practical Web Development - Fall 2023. I am currently making updates to the Fall 2023 course content with new teaching materials.
In the meantime, you can browse the previous Spring 2023 semester's course page to familiarize yourself with the course content using the link below. Please note that I don't plan to include the "JavaScript Methods" assignment in Fall 2023.
